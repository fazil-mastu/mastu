# CODE_MAP

A plain-English tour of the repo. Read the files in the order below. Every file is currently a stub with a one-line docstring, except `src/config.py`.

## Reading order
1. `docs/SPEC.md` and `CLAUDE.md` - what to build and how to work.
2. `src/config.py` - every tunable number, each with a why-comment.
3. `src/data.py` -> `src/labels.py` -> `src/features.py` -> `src/dataset.py` -> `src/models.py` -> `src/alarms.py` -> `src/evaluate.py` - the pipeline in the order the data flows.
4. `scripts/` - thin command-line entry points that call `src/`.
5. `tests/` - synthetic-data tests (no network).

## Files
